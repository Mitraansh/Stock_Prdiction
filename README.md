# Stock_Prediction
Project 
The main objective of this project is to find the best model to predict the value of the stock market. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Using this model, anyone can monitor the preferred stock that they want to invest in; and maximize profit by purchasing volume at the lowest price and liquidating the stock when it's at its highest.
